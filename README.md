> **Sashiko** (刺し子, literally "little stabs") is a form of decorative reinforcement stitching from Japan. Originally used to reinforce points of wear or to repair worn places or tears with patches, here it represents our mission to reinforce the Linux kernel through automated, intelligent patch review.

Sashiko is an agentic Linux kernel code review system. It uses a set Linux kernel-specific prompts and a special protocol to review proposed Linux kernel changes. Sashiko can ingest patches from mailing lists or local git. It's fully self contained (doesn't use any external agentic cli tools) and can work with various LLM providers.

If you are a kernel maintainer, please see our [Guide for Kernel Maintainers](MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md) for information on interacting with Sashiko.

## Quality of reviews

Sashiko is not perfect, but in our measurements the quality of reviews is high:
in our tests sashiko was able to find 53.6% (with Gemini 3.1 Pro) of bugs based on unfiltered last 1000 upstream commits with Fixed: tags.
In some sense, it's already above the human level given that 100% of these bugs made it through human-driven code reviews and were accepted to the main tree.
The rate of false positives is harder to measure, but based on limited manual reviews it's well within 20% range and the majority of it is a gray zone.

Please, note that as with any other LLM-based tools, Sashiko's output is probabilistic: it might find or not find bugs (or find other bugs) with the same input.

## Features

- **Automated Ingestion**: Monitors mailing lists (using `lore.kernel.org`) for new patch submissions.
- **Manual Ingestion**: Can ingest patches from a local git repository.
- **Self-contained**: Doesn't depend on 3rd-party tools and can work with various LLM providers (Gemini, Claude, and GitHub Copilot CLI are currently supported).
- **Web interface and CLI**: Provides a web interface and a CLI tool. Email support will be added soon.

## Prompts

Sashiko uses a multi-stage review protocol to evaluate patches thoroughly from multiple perspectives, mimicking a team of specialized reviewers.

### Review Stages
1.  **Stage 1: Analyze commit main goal.** Focuses on the big picture, architectural flaws, UAPI breakages, and conceptual correctness.
2.  **Stage 2: High-level implementation verification.** Verifies if the code matches the commit message claims, checking for missing pieces, undocumented side-effects, and API contract violations.
3.  **Stage 3: Execution flow verification.** Traces C code execution flow, checking for logic errors, missing return checks, unhandled error paths, and off-by-one errors.
4.  **Stage 4: Resource management.** Analyzes memory leaks, use-after-free (UAF), double frees, and object lifecycles across queues, timers, and workqueues.
5.  **Stage 5: Locking and synchronization.** Investigates concurrency issues, deadlocks, RCU rule violations, and thread-safety.
6.  **Stage 6: Security audit.** Audits for buffer overflows, OOB reads/writes, TOCTOU races, and information leaks (like copying uninitialized memory).
7.  **Stage 7: Hardware engineer's review.** Specifically reviews driver and hardware code for correct register accesses, DMA mapping, memory barriers, and state machine constraints.
8.  **Stage 8: Deduplication and Consolidation.** Consolidates feedback from stages 1-7, merges duplicates, and groups overlapping issues.
9.  **Stage 9: Verification and severity estimation.** Validates the consolidated concerns, filters false positives, and estimates severity.
10. **Stage 10: Report generation.** Converts confirmed findings into a polite, standard, inline-commented LKML email reply.


Also Sashiko is using per-subsystem and generic prompts, initially developed by Chris Mason:

## Important Disclaimers

Before using Sashiko, please be aware of the following:

### 1. Data Privacy and Code Sharing
Sashiko operates by sending patch data and potentially extensive portions of the Linux kernel git history to your configured Large Language Model (LLM) provider.
*   **What is shared:** This may include not just the patch being reviewed, but also related commits, file contents, and other context from the configured kernel repository to provide the LLM with sufficient context.
*   **Your responsibility:** You must ensure you are authorized and comfortable sharing this code and data with the third-party LLM provider.
*   **Liability:** The authors of Sashiko assume no responsibility for any consequences regarding data privacy, confidentiality, or intellectual property rights resulting from the transmission of this data.

### 2. Operational Costs
Running an automated review system like Sashiko can be computationally expensive and may incur significant API costs.
*   **Cost factors:** The total cost depends heavily on the volume of patches reviewed, the complexity of individual patches, and the pricing model of your chosen LLM provider and specific model.
*   **Monitoring:** It is the user's sole responsibility to monitor token usage and billing. While Sashiko may provide usage estimates, these are approximations and should not be relied upon for billing purposes.
*   **Liability:** The authors of Sashiko are not responsible for any financial costs, fees, or unexpected charges incurred by the use of this software.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Version 1.90 or later.
- **Git**: For managing the repository and kernel tree.
- **LLM Provider API Key**: Access to an LLM provider (e.g., Google's Gemini or Anthropic's Claude).

## Installation

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install sashiko
```

### From source

#### 1.  **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sashiko-dev/sashiko.git
cd sashiko
```
*Note: The `--recursive` flag is important to initialize the `linux` kernel source submodule.*

#### 2.  **Configuration**:
Copy `Settings.toml` to customize your configuration. The default `Settings.toml` includes sections for:
*   **Database**: SQLite database path (`sashiko.db`).
*   **NNTP**: Server details and groups to monitor.
*   **AI**: Provider and model selection.
*   **Server**: API server host and port.
*   **Git**: Path to the reference kernel repository.
*   **Review**: Concurrency and worktree settings.

#### Configuring the LLM Provider

Sashiko supports multiple LLM providers (e.g. `gemini`). You must configure the provider and model in `Settings.toml`. There are no default values, so please set them explicitly.

For example configurations of each supported provider, see the `docs/examples/` directory.

You can copy the base Gemini configuration like so:

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.example.toml Settings.toml
```

You can also configure settings via environment variables using the `SASHIKO` prefix and `__` (double underscore) as the separator between every segment (e.g., `SASHIKO__AI__PROVIDER=gemini`).

**Important**: You must set the `LLM_API_KEY` environment variable with your provider's API key.
```bash
export LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

#### Claude Setup

Sashiko supports Anthropic's Claude models via the Claude API.

**Get an API key**: https://console.anthropic.com/

**Configure environment**:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
# Or use the generic key (LLM_API_KEY serves as fallback):
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

**Update Settings.toml**:
Copy `docs/examples/Settings.claude.toml` to your `Settings.toml` and adjust as needed.

**Features**:
- Automatic prompt caching (5-minute TTL) reduces costs for repeated context
- Full tool/function calling support for git operations
- Automatic retry logic for rate limits and API overload
- 200K context window for Claude models (use max_input_tokens = 40000 for cost-conscious defaults)
- Extended thinking support via `thinking` and `effort` settings

#### Claude Code CLI Setup

Sashiko can use a local [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) install as
a completion backend. This path uses your Claude Code subscription, so there is
no per-token API charge and no API key to configure.

**Prerequisites**: Install Claude Code and sign in. Verify with `claude --version`.

**Update Settings.toml**:
Copy `docs/examples/Settings.claude-cli.toml` to your `Settings.toml` and adjust as needed.

`model` accepts any identifier the CLI accepts via `--model`: aliases like
`opus` or `sonnet`, or full names like `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

Context window notes:
- `claude-opus-4-7` gives you 1M tokens by default.
- `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-opus-4-6` have 1M capability per Anthropic's
  docs, but the CLI defaults them to 200K. Append the `[1m]` suffix
  (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6[1m]`) to opt into the 1M variant.
- `claude-haiku-4-5` is 200K only; there is no 1M variant.
- The CLI rejects pre-thinking models (Claude 3.x family) with HTTP 404.

**Features**:
- No API key needed. Uses Claude Code's subscription auth.
- Stateless: spawns `claude --print --output-format json --no-session-persistence`
  per request. No tool access, no file access, no session reuse.
- Prompt caching is handled by Claude Code automatically.
- `effort` is forwarded to `claude --effort` and controls the model's thinking
  budget. The exact mode depends on the model: Opus 4.7 uses adaptive
  thinking, Sonnet 4.6 and Haiku 4.5 use extended thinking. The CLI exposes
  one knob (effort) for both; if you need to pick the mode explicitly or
  disable thinking, use `provider = "claude"` (API) instead.
- `[ai.claude]` settings (`prompt_caching`, `thinking`, etc.) are read only by
  the API provider above. They are ignored on this path.

**Notes**: Each review may spawn many CLI processes. Lower `review.concurrency`
if you hit subscription rate limits.

#### GitHub Copilot CLI Setup

Sashiko can use a local [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli)
install as a completion backend. This path uses your GitHub Copilot
subscription, so there is no per-token API charge and no API key to configure.

**Prerequisites**:
- `copilot` CLI installed and on `$PATH`
- Authenticated session (run `copilot` once interactively to authenticate)

**Update Settings.toml**:
Copy `docs/examples/Settings.copilot-cli.toml` to your `Settings.toml` and adjust as needed.

**Notes**:
- `model` follows GitHub Copilot's catalog (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4.5`,
  `gpt-5.5`); pick a model your subscription has access to.
- Sashiko invokes `copilot` with `--disable-builtin-mcps`,
  `--no-custom-instructions`, and `--allow-all-tools` so the provider is used
  as a text-completion-with-tools backend only — no MCP servers, no
  `AGENTS.md`.
- The prompt is sent via stdin (not `-p <argv>`) to avoid Linux's
  `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` cap (~128 KB per argv element).
- `max_interactions` controls how many tool-call rounds the provider permits
  before aborting, the same as `claude-cli`.
- Each review may spawn many `copilot` processes. Lower `review.concurrency`
  if you hit subscription rate limits.

#### AWS Bedrock Setup

Sashiko supports AWS Bedrock via the Converse API, which works with any Bedrock-hosted model (Claude, Llama, Mistral, etc.).

**Prerequisites**: Enable model access in the [AWS Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for your desired model and region.

**Configure AWS credentials** using any standard method:
```bash
# Option 1: Environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# Option 2: AWS CLI profile (~/.aws/credentials)
aws configure
```

**Update Settings.toml**:
Copy `docs/examples/Settings.claude-bedrock.toml` to your `Settings.toml` and adjust as needed.

**Features**:
- Uses the Converse API — works with any Bedrock-hosted model
- No API key needed — uses standard AWS IAM authentication
- Supports cross-region inference profiles (e.g., `us.anthropic.claude-*`)
- Full tool/function calling support for git operations

#### Google Cloud Vertex AI Setup

Sashiko supports Google Cloud Vertex AI, which provides access to Claude models (and potentially other model families) via Google Cloud infrastructure. Build with `--features vertex`.

**Prerequisites**: Enable the Vertex AI API and model access in the [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/model-garden) for your desired model and region.

**Configure GCP credentials**:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Configure environment**:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID="my-gcp-project"
export CLOUD_ML_REGION="us-east5"  # or "global" for global endpoints
```

**Update Settings.toml**:
Copy `docs/examples/Settings.claude-vertex.toml` to your `Settings.toml` and adjust as needed.

**Features**:
- Model-agnostic routing layer — currently supports Claude, extensible to other model families
- No API key needed — uses Google Cloud Application Default Credentials (ADC)
- Supports global, multi-region, and regional endpoints
- 1M context window for Claude Opus 4.7/4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 on Vertex
- Full tool/function calling and prompt caching support

#### Kiro CLI Setup

Sashiko supports using the local `kiro-cli` as a completion backend.

**Prerequisites**: Install `kiro-cli` and authenticate with `KIRO_API_KEY` or a browser login.

**Update Settings.toml**:
Copy `docs/examples/Settings.kiro-cli.toml` to your `Settings.toml` and adjust as needed.

**Features**:
- Runs `kiro-cli acp` as a stateless completion backend
- Kiro native tools are disabled by default; Sashiko's own tool protocol is used instead
- An isolated temporary agent with a deny-all hook prevents accidental tool execution

#### 3.  **Build**:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Sashiko consists of two main components: the **Daemon** and the **CLI**.

### 1. Daemon

The daemon is responsible for monitoring mailing lists, managing the database, and coordinating the AI review process. It also provides a Web UI and an API for the CLI.

To start the daemon:

```bash
sashiko
```

(Or from source: `cargo run`, or via Nix: `nix run github:sashiko-dev/sashiko`)

### 2. CLI

The CLI (`sashiko-cli`) allows you to interact with the running Sashiko daemon
or run standalone local reviews from your terminal. For the full command
reference, including local review setup and all options, see the
[CLI Reference](docs/sashiko-cli.md).

Quick start:

```bash
# Submit patches to a running daemon
sashiko-cli submit HEAD~3..HEAD

# Run a local review (no daemon required)
sashiko-cli local --force-local

# Check review status
sashiko-cli show latest
```

(From source: `cargo run --bin sashiko-cli -- [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]`,
or via Nix: `nix profile add github:sashiko-dev/sashiko`)

### 3. Local Review

Sashiko can review your patches locally without sending emails to LKML or
updating sashiko.dev. See the
[CLI Reference](docs/sashiko-cli.md#local) for full setup, options, and
a comparison of all three review modes.

### 4. Web Interface

Once the daemon is running, you can access the Web UI, the daemon will print the
URL to access it from localhost.

## Benchmarking

To evaluate the AI's review performance against a set of known issues, follow this workflow:

1.  **Prepare the environment:**
    Move or drop the existing database to start with a clean state.
    ```bash
    mv sashiko.db sashiko.db.bak
    ```

2.  **Run the benchmark tool:**
    Use the unified `benchmark` tool with a benchmark JSON file (e.g., `benchmark_small.json`). This tool will automatically ingest the patches, wait for all AI review processes to complete in the background, and then dynamically evaluate the generated findings against ground-truth descriptions.
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin benchmark -- --file benchmarks/benchmark_small.json
    ```

    *   A summary of detection rates (Detected, Missed, Partially Detected) along with performance metrics (Average Tokens In/Out, Average Turns, Average Time) and counts of total concerns and findings will be printed to the console upon completion.
    *   Detailed evaluation results are written to `benchmark_results.json` in the current working directory, which contains explanations from the AI judge for each finding.

## Communication

We welcome contributions and feedback through two main channels:

*   **GitHub:** Feel free to use GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests, and submit Pull Requests for code changes.
*   **Mailing List:** Join us at `sashiko@lists.linux.dev` (archived at [lore.kernel.org](https://lore.kernel.org/sashiko)) for Sashiko-related announcements and broader AI-review discussions, including general feedback, architectural ideas, and specific prompt discussions. Automated patch reviews are sent from and should be replied to `sashiko-reviews@lists.linux.dev`.

## Contributing

This project uses the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). All contributions must include a `Signed-off-by` line to certify that you wrote the code or have the right to contribute it.

You can automatically add this line by using the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s
```

## Development

This project was built using Gemini CLI. If you're using other development agents, make sure they follow the guidance in GEMINI.md.
Please, make sure your code is working before sending PR. Make sure it can be built without warnings, all tests pass, run cargo fmt and clippy.
If you're changing AI-related parts, please, run at least several code reviews.
Development got much faster these days, but testing is as important as ever.

### Gemini CLI Skills

For users of the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli), we provide specialized skills to automate development workflows:

- **`review-pr`**: Performs deep, scrutinizing code reviews against `GEMINI.md` and design documents. Detects relevant design files automatically and generates categorized findings with ready-to-paste diffs.
- **`sashiko-feature`**: A meta-skill for implementing new features. It handles design document matching, codebase investigation, and ensures adherence to SOLID/DRY principles in Rust, while iteratively running `make` checks.

#### Installing Skills

To install these skills in your local workspace:

```bash
gemini skills install ./skills/review-pr.skill --scope workspace
gemini skills install ./skills/sashiko-feature.skill --scope workspace
/skills reload
```

For users of other agent interfaces (e.g., OpenCode, Claude Code), we recommend following your interface's specific settings to symlink or copy the skill configurations (the `SKILL.md` and `references/` files) into your agent's custom instruction path.
